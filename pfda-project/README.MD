## Project: Analyse the planning applications submitted to Clare County Council over 2025

#### Project Description - Related to my current work, my undergrad degree and my home county, this is a topic I am very interested in. The development cycle can take upward of 2.5 years from planning application submission to dwelling completion - given the current housing crisis knowing how many applications are currently in the system is very important. All local authorities in the country have also increased their housing targets with new government policy in place. For Clare this has increased from 550 units annually to 985 an increase of 79%.

#### The dataset I used has planning application data for all 31 local authorities in Ireland going back several decades. This is a very powerful database and a useful tool to understand the recent history of specific sites or areas ([Planning Application Mapping Tool](https://planning.geohive.ie/datasets/housinggovie::irishplanningapplications/explore?filters=eyJQbGFubmluZ0F1dGhvcml0eSI6WyJDbGFyZSBDb3VudHkgQ291bmNpbCJdLCJSZWNlaXZlZERhdGUiOlsxNzM1Njg5NjAwMDAwLDI3MDQyMzM2MDAwMDBdfQ%3D%3D&layer=0))
